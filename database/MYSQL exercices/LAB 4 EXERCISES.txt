LAB 4 - Joshua Camilo


Exercicio 1 - Show all the information about students and the course associated with them.
R: select * from student, course
where stu_cour_id = cour_id



Exercicio 2 - Display only the student name and the course name
R: select Full_Name, cour_name from student, course
where stu_cour_id = cour_id



Exercicio 3 - Display the class name and the department associated to it.
R: select cla_name, dep_name
from class, department
where cla_dep_id = dep_id



Exercicio 4 - Display the study plan for each course (course name, class name, semester)
R: select cour_name, cla_name, plan_semester
from studyplan, course, class
where plan_cour_id = cour_id and plan_cla_id = cla_id;



Exercicio 5 - Display the Study Plan for “Creative 
Technologies”, sorted by semester
R: SELECT cl.cla_name,
       sp.plan_semester
FROM studyplan sp
JOIN course c ON sp.plan_cour_id = c.cour_id
JOIN class cl ON sp.plan_cla_id = cl.cla_id
WHERE c.cour_name = 'Creative Technologies'
ORDER BY sp.plan_semester, cl.cla_name;



6 - Show which courses have classes taught  
by the “IADE-Tech” department
R: SELECT DISTINCT c.cour_name
FROM course c
JOIN studyplan sp ON sp.plan_cour_id = c.cour_id
JOIN class cl ON sp.plan_cla_id = cl.cla_id
JOIN department d ON cl.cla_dep_id = d.dep_id
WHERE d.dep_initials = 'IADE-Tech'
ORDER BY c.cour_name;




7 - Display the list of all classes taught in the 
1st semester of the “Game Development”
R: SELECT cl.cla_name
FROM studyplan sp
JOIN course c ON sp.plan_cour_id = c.cour_id
JOIN class cl ON sp.plan_cla_id = cl.cla_id
WHERE c.cour_name = 'Games Development'
  AND sp.plan_semester = 1
ORDER BY cl.cla_name;




8 - Build groups of 2 students,    and for both 
students display their name and course id
R: SELECT s1.stu_name ,
       s1.stu_cour_id ,
       s2.stu_name,
       s2.stu_cour_id 
FROM student s1
JOIN student s2
  ON s1.stu_id < s2.stu_id;




9 - Repeat the previous exercise, guaranteeing that 
there are no groups with the same students
R: SELECT s1.stu_name ,
       s1.stu_cour_id ,
       s2.stu_name ,
       s2.stu_cour_id 
FROM student s1
JOIN student s2
  ON s1.stu_id < s2.stu_id;



10 - Build groups of two students, belonging 
to the same course
R: SELECT s1.stu_name AS student1,
       s2.stu_name AS student2,
       s1.stu_cour_id AS course_id
FROM student s1
JOIN student s2
  ON s1.stu_id < s2.stu_id
 AND s1.stu_cour_id = s2.stu_cour_id;
